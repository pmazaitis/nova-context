## Requirements

To build PDF files, you will need to a `context` binary installed (either stand-alone, or from a TeX distribution). This extension will start a login shell to run the `context` binary: the extension should be able to find the binary if it is within the PATH environment variable for your default login shell. You may also explicitly configure the extension with an absolute path to a specific `context` binary if needed.

The automatically preview compiled PDFs, you will need to install [Skim.app](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/).

## Usage

Syntax highlighting, folding, document hierarchy, and spellchecking work out of the box.
